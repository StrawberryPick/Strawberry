# sprintBacklog for Week 1
Here we link tasks to Week 1. 
All tasks are actaully defined in sprintBackLogTasks folder and linked here from there. 
There is a possibility that some tasks in sprintBackLogTasks folder may not have links in any sprint backlog file. That need to be checked somehow with a specific script. 

You can here also have link to anything in Code folder or Scrum folder to link it to relevant codefile or Scrum administrative document. back and forth links are feasible.
