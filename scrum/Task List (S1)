Data Sources
  Data Gathering
    After we determined what information we wanted to collect, we set a timeframe for data collection. The following step is to select a data gathering technique and then begin collecting data.
    Result: Various tables and databases containing the data. In addition: List of data sources in md file. 
  Evaluate gathered data
    After we gather the data, the data needs to be evaluated before we select which information will be in analysing.
    Result: Md document describing selected data with justification (of selection.

Data Selection
  Based on Relevant timeframe 
    - automate data selection for daily cases to select what will be relevant to any given days crops time wise
    Result: consolidated tables selected for relevant timelines

Data Cleaning
   Remove noise
    Remove or rectify statistical noise, such as misinputs, missing inputs, duplicate records
    Result: cleaned tables and DBâ€™s
  Identify anomalies
    Identify anomalies in the data and decide if they are erroneous readings or worth keeping
    Result: cleaned data and anomaly report

Data Transformation
  Collect Inputs
    This process includes collecting all selected data after identifying anomalies removing all noises.
   Unify all inputs to table
    This step is based on unifying all collected data inputs into one and getting ready data for final analysing.
  Read Single inputs
    In this process, when we wish to evaluate a range of data values in an input field, we configure a set of rules to read every single data input. 

Data Analytics
  Make analysis programs
    Create and test the analysis programs
    Result: Working code
  Analyse given data
    Run the data through our analysis algorithms
    Result: analysis system output, probably a text database

Interpretation and Evaluation
  Interpret acquired data
    Put the analysis results in a dashboard and on the website
    Result: Dashboards with the data
  Evaluate results
    Evaluate the success of our predictions and determine if the process needs improvement
    Result: Report
