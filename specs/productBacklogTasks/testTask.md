# template task file
Free descritpion of task. This is big task, of the product backlog. 
Here also sprint related task de-composition. Meaning tasks devided to actionable tasks to be implemented as source code files and/or detailed configuration and installation documents. 
[test sub task name](..\sprintBacklogTasks\sprintTestTask.md), for any sprint. 
# general planning on how to achieve proper document structure
Need to choose if making documents under this folder is appropriate or not. 
Initially we will be having folder for all sprint backlog tasks, as a total
In folder generalSprintBacklog on the same level as product BacklogTask. That folder is having ProductBacklog tasks devided to actionable tasks. 

Those tasks are then "connected" to actual sprints. 
This system keeps up with the scrum team work on designing the big backlog tasks to smaller actionable sprint backlog tasks. Which can be then attached to sprint, detached from it or deleted and reshaped. 

To be fair, Azure devops does have this covered, but what is planned here is avoiding so called "Vendor lock in" effectively.
