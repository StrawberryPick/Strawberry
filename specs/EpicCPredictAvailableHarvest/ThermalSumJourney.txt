Thermal Sum 
In order to calculate it we needed to find the maximum and minimum temperatures in a day as well as the base temperature of the strawberry plant which is a constant. Thermal sum is very important for crop harvest data generation as it showcased the period and the rate of growth of Strawberys.  
There is not much cleaning to be done as the data obtain is very focused on the area we need.
Excel was used to visualize the bell curve of the thermal sum which will define the period in which we can concentrate on generating cropse data. 
Python will be used to implement that data to the crop generation data.
