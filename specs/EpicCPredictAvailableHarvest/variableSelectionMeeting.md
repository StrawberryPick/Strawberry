# Thermal Sum
Summer crops like cotton and maize have not developed to grow at cold temperature. Therefore, they have a base temperature well above 0. Cotton for example, has a base temperature of 12°C so when the average temperature is below 12 no growth occurs. The use of a base temperature increases the complexity of our simple day degree calculation to. 
Another way of thinking about this is as a switch when you are above the base temperature, in this case 12, you can accumulate Day degrees (Figure 4). This diagram also shows a maximum, that is a temperature when day degrees won’t be accumulated because it is too hot, and the plant stops growing. 
In order to calculate it we needed to find the maximum and minimum temperatures in a day as well as the base temperature of the strawberry plant which is a constant. Thermal sum is very important for crop harvest data generation as it showcased the period and the rate of growth of Strawberys.

# Sunlight Duration 
Sunlight, temperature, and precipitation during the growing season all have a significant impact on crop development and production. Temperature and water availability are the two most critical environmental elements affecting crop output. 
Plant leaves absorb the most sunlight due to their broad shape (flattened surfaces), where plant stems from a sturdy framework to maintain leaves straight and allow for maximum solar exposure. Plant cells include the green pigment chlorophyll as well as organelles called chloroplasts, which are essential components of the photosynthesis process. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen, meaning plants use the energy they get from the sun to make food. 


# Wind
Wind will be an important variable to our problem. The unit we are going to use is m/s and wind will be correlated with the crop generation data.

# Ultraviolet Radiation
High UV radiation can cause blooming to be delayed in a variety of crops. UV has no effect on early bud or flower development or the time to first blossom in some crops. In many plant species, ultraviolet light affects flower size, anther number, pollen production, germination, and tube development. UV radiation cause declines in the development of leaves and stems. The reduction in development of the leaflets, primary stalk, or branches is due to a reduction in cell division instead of a decline in cell size.

# Rain
There are various reasons why rainfall is preferable than groundwater for crops, but the most essential is biochemistry. Chlorine is a required disinfectant in water from the tap, while fluoride is added to prevent cavities. We were unable to locate any rain data for the specified time that did not necessitate payment.
