# Sunlight-duration 

Plant leaves absorb the most sunlight due to their broad shape (flattened surfaces), where plant stems from a sturdy framework to maintain leaves straight and allow for maximum solar exposure. Plant cells include the green pigment chlorophyll as well as organelles called chloroplasts, which are essential components of the photosynthesis process. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen, meaning plants use the energy they get from the sun to make food.

## Modify Sunshine time data in order to have 1 value per day in hour format.

- Based on data downloaded from FMI https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations 
- Dividing length of time with 60 â€“ as data was given in minutes of sunlight within one given hour
- Summarizing all hours in one day (sum of 24 characters per day)
- From 8760 summarizing to 365 rows
- Presenting data findings visually
